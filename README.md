# Advent of Code 2020

Presenting the "I don't really know C++" edition of Advent of Code 2020!

## Building and running

First, run:

```bash
$ make common
```

Then, whichever day you'd like to make, you can call `make` on. For example, to build day 3:

```bash
$ make day3
```

Then, the resulting binary will be in the `bin` directory. As in:

```bash
$ ./bin/day3
```
